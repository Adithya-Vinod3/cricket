to play a single game:

type python3 cricket.py and follow the instructions on-screen

if this doesn't work, you may need to download python from https://www.python.org/

to sim a series of games between two teams:

type python3 series.py for historical (including all-time) teams

type python3 customseries.py for custom teams


to simulate a league between a series of teams:

type python3 league.py for historical (including all-time) teams

type python3 customleague.py for custom teams
